# üéÆ CS 230 ‚Äì Draw It or Lose It: Software Design Portfolio

This repository contains all course deliverables for *The Gaming Room* client project, completed during SNHU‚Äôs CS 230: Software Design & Development.  
The client required expanding their Android-only drawing game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a multi-platform, web-based, distributed application.

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Module 8: Journal Reflection

**Who was the client and what were their software needs?**  
The Gaming Room, creator of *Draw It or Lose It*, wanted to expand their Android game into a web-based app usable across desktop and mobile platforms.

**What did I do well?**  
I structured the software design cleanly and applied design patterns effectively. My system evaluations were thorough and well-aligned with client needs.

**What helped during the design phase?**  
The document gave me a clear framework to guide development. Writing out design constraints and platform decisions helped me avoid rework later.

**What would I revise?**  
I would refine the UML diagram and make clearer connections between classes. Also, I‚Äôd break down the domain model with more real-use examples.

**How did I meet user needs?**  
By prioritizing cross-platform compatibility, secure login, and scalable architecture‚Äîall central to The Gaming Room‚Äôs expansion plan.

**How did I approach software design and what will I do next time?**  
I broke the problem into layers (presentation, logic, backend) and used proven patterns. In the future, I‚Äôll integrate testing and CI/CD from the start.
