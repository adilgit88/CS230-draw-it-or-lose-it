# üéÆ CS 230 ‚Äì Draw It or Lose It: Software Design Portfolio

This repository contains all course deliverables for *The Gaming Room* client project, completed during SNHU‚Äôs CS 230: Software Design & Development.  
The client required expanding their Android-only drawing game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a multi-platform, web-based, distributed application.

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Module 8: Journal Reflection

**1. Who was the client and what were their software needs?**
The client was The Gaming Room, seeking to expand their existing Android-only game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based and multi-platform distributed application.

**2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I clearly identified the client‚Äôs needs and applied design patterns effectively. My system evaluation was detailed and justified based on the requirements.

**3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
It helped me structure my thoughts and plan the development stages. By outlining design constraints and platform characteristics, I could make more informed decisions before writing code.

**4. If you could revise one part of the work, what would it be?**
I would include more technical diagrams like component or deployment diagrams for visual clarity. These would enhance communication with developers.

**5. How did you interpret the user‚Äôs needs and implement them in your software design? Why is it important?**
I broke down user stories and system goals into concrete components, such as ensuring unique names and single instances. Meeting user needs ensures the system is both functional and intuitive.

**6. How did you approach designing software? What would you use again in future designs?**
I used modular thinking, applied common design patterns, and emphasized system scalability and security. In the future, I‚Äôll also use tools like UML diagrams and agile documentation to improve the planning phase.
