## 📘 Module Eight Journal Responses

**Who was the client and what were their software needs?**  
The Gaming Room, which created *Draw It or Lose It*, needed to expand the Android game into a web-based distributed platform supporting multiple operating systems.

**What did I do well?**  
I clearly documented system design, applied proper patterns, and presented pros/cons for each OS.

**What helped while writing the design document?**  
The design doc gave structure and planning before jumping into code, saving time and confusion.

**What would I revise?**  
I’d make the UML more detailed and better explain inheritance.

**How did I meet the user's needs?**  
I designed for scalability, cross-platform support, and secure user access based on their goals.

**How did I approach software design and what will I do next time?**  
I broke it down by functionality and used proven design patterns. In the future, I’d add test automation and CI/CD tools.
